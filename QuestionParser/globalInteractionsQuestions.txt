<string>protecting Japan from early European exploration</string>
<key>answer</key>
<string>1</string>
<key>explanation</key>
<string>Explanation: During the 300s-400s AD, Korea acted as a conduit for the transfer of culture from China to Japan. Archaeological discoveries indicate that a continuous flow of new technologies, materials, and immigrants was arriving in Japan from the Korea Peninsula. The Japanese learned how to cast bronze spearheads and bells, and historical records indicate that, by the late 5th century, Korean artisans had brought in more advanced methods of working iron, making swords and armor, firing finer and more durable ceramics, and manufacturing stirrups, bridles, and saddles. The Chinese writing system was introduced to Japan at about the same time. Writing made it possible for a new specialized class of scribes to compile and keep records, and it opened Japan to the influence of Chinese literary, religious, and philosophical culture. Soon after, Korean scholars introduced Confucianism and Buddhism to Japan.</string>
