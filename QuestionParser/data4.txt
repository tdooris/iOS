Correct Answer Number: 1

Explanation: During the 300s-400s AD, Korea acted as a conduit for the transfer of culture from China to Japan.

The Chinese writing system was introduced to Japan at about the same time. Writing made it possible for a new specialized class of scribes to compile and keep records, and it opened Japan to the influence of Chinese literary, religious, and philosophical culture. Soon after, Korean scholars introduced Confucianism and Buddhism to Japan.
